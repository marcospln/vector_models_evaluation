# Datasets for intrinsic evaluation of vector space models for Galician

This repository contains several datasets for evaluating vector space models (also known as word-embeddings) for Galician (using the ILG/RAG orthography). It includes four datasets of two tasks: one for word analogies and three for concept categorisation.

## Word analogies
The word analogies dataset (GGAT) is based on the [Google Analogy Test](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/questions-words.txt) (Mikolov et al, 2013).

## Concept categorisation
The concept categorisation datasets are based on:

* The Almuhareb & Poesio dataset [AP](https://github.com/vecto-ai/word-benchmarks/blob/master/word-categorization/monolingual/en/ap.csv) (Almuhareb, 2006), named G-AP in this repository.

* The ESSLLI dataset [ESSLLI](https://github.com/vecto-ai/word-benchmarks/blob/master/word-categorization/monolingual/en/essli-2008.csv) (Baroni _et al._, 2008), named G-ESSLLI in this repository.

* The Battig dataset [Battig](https://github.com/vecto-ai/word-benchmarks/blob/master/word-categorization/monolingual/en/battig.csv) (Baroni, _et al._, 2010), named G-Battig in this repository.
